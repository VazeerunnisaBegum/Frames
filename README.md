# Frames
Created an HTML webpage using <iframe> to embed multiple pages.<br>
Included three frames displaying image.html, text.html, and link.html.<br>
Center-aligned frames for a structured layout.<br>
Added a <noframes> fallback message for browsers that do not support frames.<br>
Ensured proper height for frames to enhance visibility.
